# vr-samp-launcher

**it is a simple launcher developed in webview2... it is nothing more than a “loader” made to load a specific anticheat for samp...**

## features

* automatically download `samp.dll` and `bac.dll` when opening the launcher.

* inject `samp.dll` and `bac.dll` directly into the gta_sa.exe process, without the need for external injectors.

* saves the player name, to make it independent of the samp regex.

`this code is generally crap, and it uses some methods that are also crap... it was done in 2 days and never finished. it was just to do a little research on webview2.`
